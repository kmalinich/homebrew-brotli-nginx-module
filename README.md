homebrew-brotli-nginx-module
=====================

A set of [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) formulae to install [`ngx_brotli`](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) support on macOS.  

(Worth noting is the nginx formula still needs to be edited to add support to use brotli-nginx-module, but it's trivial)  

The forumlae are head-only.  

## Usage

    brew tap kmalinich/brotli-nginx-module
    brew install --HEAD brotli-nginx-module
